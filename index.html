   <p style = "margin-top: 70px;"><strong>&emsp;&emsp;League of Legends is a 5v5 MOBA(Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), where the main goal is to destroy the enemies base aka their Nexus. There are a variety of champions with different strengths and synergies to achieve this goal. </strong></p><br><br>

   <p style = "font-size: 28px;"><strong>Many players over time find champions and playstyles that suit how they play the game best. I personally play Cassiopeia because she is very strong in 1v1s and I like emoting on people after I absolutely destroy them. This website tracks a small portion of the overall league playerbase including those present in its professional eSports scene. DrywallEnjoyer also happens to be me :)</strong></p>
